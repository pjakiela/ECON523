# Clustering

<br>

## Overview  

This is the second of three modules on power calculations. In this module, weâ€™ll learn how to determine the appropriate sample size 
or cluster-randomized trials. Researchers often assign treatment at the cluster level (e.g. at the school, community, or market level) 
when we are worried about potential spillovers across individuals within a cluster. However, if outcomes within a cluster are correlated 
(as they usually are), we need to modify our approach to calculating statistical power and sample size.
