# Selection Bias and the Experimental Ideal

<br>

## Overview  

This module introduces the **potential outcomes** framework that we'll use throughout the course as well as the concept of **selection bias** before 
explaining how average treatment effects can be estimated when treatment status is randomly assigned.

<details><summary>Review Questions</summary>
  <br>
  <ol>
  <li>How do Americans with health insurance differ from those without health insurance?  Are those differences likely to represent the causal effects of having health insurance?  Why or why not? </li>
  <li>What are potential outcomes?  How do potential outcomes lead to a missing data problem in causal inference?  </li>
  <li>What is selection bias, and what implications does it have for program evaluation?  </li>
  <li>What is the Law of Large Numbers, and why is it important in randomized experiments?  </li>
  <li>Based on the evidence presented in the reading, what are the impacts of access to health insurance (in the United States)?  </li>
