# Using ML to Select Covariates

<br>

## Overview  

This is the third of three modules on power calculations. In this module, weâ€™ll learn how to use machine learning 
to choose a set of baseline covariates to include when we estimate treatment effects, and we'll also learn how 
the choice of covariates influences the required sample size.
