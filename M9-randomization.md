# Randomization in Practice

<br>

## Overview  

In this module, we'll be learning how to randomly assign treatment status in a way 
that is transparent and reproducible.  After assigning treatments, we'll check 
whether we've succeeded in creating a treatment group and a control group 
that are comparable in terms of their observable characteristics.
