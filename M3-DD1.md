# 2x2 Diff-in-Diff 

<br>

## Overview  

This module introduces the difference-in-differences identification strategy. We review the basic setup and assumptions necessary for the diff-in-diff estimator to provide a valid estimate of the causal effect. We also survey some of the seminal early applications of diff-in-diff estimation to social policy.
