# Empirical Exercise 3
   
In this exercise, we're going to analyze data from Ignaz Semmelweis' handwashing intervention in the maternity hospital in Vienna.  The data come from 
Semmelweis' (1861) book, and [some helpful person put them on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_mortality_rates_of_puerperal_fever#Yearly_mortality_rates_for_birthgiving_women_1784%E2%80%931849). 
We'll be reading them in from excel using the import excel command.
