# Empirical Exercise 7

In this exercise, we'll use data from Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy's paper 
[Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Scholastic Achievement](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2587016), 
which was published in the _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ in 1999.  The paper makes use of the fact that class sizes in Israeli public 
schools are capped at 40.  Thus, if there are 40 students in a grade within a school, they are likely to be grouped into a single class; 
but if there are 41 students, the school must divide the grade into two classes taught by different teachers.  This creates a discontinuity in 
class size as a function of grade-level cohort size.
