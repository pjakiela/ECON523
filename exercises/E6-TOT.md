# Empirical Exercise 6  

In this exercise, we'll be using data from the paper [The Miracle of Microfinance?  Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43189512?seq=1) by 
Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, and Cynthia Kinnan.  The paper reports the results of one of the first randomized evaluations of a microcredit 
intervention.  The authors worked with an Indian MFI (microfinance institution) called Spandana that was expanding into the city of Hyderabad.  Spandana 
identified 104 neighborhoods where it would be willing to open branches.  They couldn't open branches in all the neighborhoods simultaneously, so they worked with 
the researchers to assign half of them to a treatment group where branches would be opened immediately.  Spandana held off on opening branches in 
the control neighborhoods until after the study.  

Before getting started, take a look at this [J-PAL policy brief on the impacts of microfinance](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/microcredit-impacts-and-limitations).  We'll be using 
a small slice of the data from the paper by Banerjee, Duflo, Glennerster, and Kinnan to explore the use of **instrumental variables** techniques to estimate impacts 
of **treatment on the treated** - and to think about when such methods are appropriate.

## Getting Started

The data that we will use in this exercise is available [here](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON523/exercises/E6-BanerjeeEtAl-data.dta).  The data set 
contains information on 6,863 households in 104 neighborhoods in Hyderabad; these households were randomly sampled form 
the local population, so not all of them will have chosen to take out loans from an MFI. Half of the neighborhoods (52 of 104) were randomly assigned 
to treatment (and the rest to control).  The variable `treatment` indicates treatment status, and the variable `areaid` is a neighborhood identifier.  

We will be using the following outcome variables:

- `spandana_1` is an indicator for taking out a loan from Spandana (the MFI)
- `bizprofit_1` is a measure of microenterprise profits
- `bizrev_1` is a measure of microenterprise revenues
- `bizassets_1` is a measure of assets owned by one's microenterprise
- `any_biz_1` is an indicator for operating a microenterprise
