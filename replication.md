# Replication Project

This exercise makes use of the data set [Card-Krueger-1994-data.dta](Card-Krueger-1994-data.dta), 
which was first used in the paper [Minimum Wages and Employment:  A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2677856) by David Card 
and Alan Krueger, published in the _American Economic Review_ in 1994. The authors 
examine the impacts of a change in New Jersey's minumum wage law 
that took effect in April of 1992.  

For this assignment, you will produce a replication and extension of Card and Krueger's analysis.  Specifically, 
you will be replicating Table 2 as well as portions of Tables 3 and 4.  In addition, 
you will need to produce one table of additional analysis - either a replication 
of a specification (or multiple specifications) that appears later in the paper, or new analysis of 
your own devising.  More original and/or challenging extensions will receive more credit.

Details of the assignment are available [here](ECON523-replication-2023-02-24.pdf).  This  
[paper template](paper-template-short.docx) provides a suggested structure for your write-up.  Your empirical results 
must be nicely formatted, and your do files should replicate your tables (both the results and the layout).  Guidance 
on exporting tables from stata to word (or excel or latex) is available [here](https://pjakiela.github.io/stata/making-tables.html).
