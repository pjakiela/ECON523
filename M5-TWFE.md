# Two-Way Fixed Effects

<br>

## Overview  

In this module, we look at the use of two-way fixed effects to estimate generalized difference-in-differences models 
when treatment timing varies across treated units. Weâ€™ll see that the mis-specification and weighting issues that 
we discussed in the context of continuous variation in treatment intensity are also relevant here:  two-way fixed effects estimates 
can be severely biased when treatment timing is staggered and treatment effects on individual units are not constant over time.
