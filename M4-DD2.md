# Diff-in-Diff in Panel Data

<br>

## Overview  
This module covers regression approaches to difference-in-differences estimation (without staggered treatment timing).  We review 
the basic two-by-two difference-in-differences regression specifications, and discuss extensions that allow for continuous variation in treatent intensity 
and the inclusion of period-specific and unit-specific fixed effects.
